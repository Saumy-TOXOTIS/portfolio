# Saumy Tiwari's 3D Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. This project is designed to be more than just a static page; it's an immersive digital experience that showcases my skills in web development and creative design. It leverages the power of 3D and scroll-based animations to guide the user through my work, skills, and contact information.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Scroll-Driven 3D Animations:** The central 3D object rotates and moves based on the user's scroll position, guided by the powerful GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and its ScrollTrigger plugin.
*   **Interactive 3D Model:** The background is a live, interactive 3D scene created with Spline and integrated seamlessly into the React application.
*   **Smooth Page Transitions:** Seamless navigation between the Home, About, Projects, and Contact sections with fluid animations for content entrances.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with the latest tools including React 19, Vite for a blazing-fast development experience, and Framer Motion for delightful micro-interactions.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The layout and animations are designed to look and work great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
*   **Auto-Deploy Workflow:** Hosted on Render with continuous deployment integrated with this GitHub repository. Every `push` to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new build and deployment.
